    <p>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series,
    developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH.
    M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series
    since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.</p>

    <p>The initial model was available in a coupé body style,
    with a convertible body style added soon after.
    M3 Sedans were available during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations.
    Since 2014, the M3 has been solely produced in the sedan body style,
    due to the coupé and convertible models being rebranded as the 4 Series range,
    making the high-performance variant the M4.</p>

    <p>Upgrades over the regular 3 Series models include engines,
    handling, brakes, aerodynamics, lightweight materials and various interior upgrades.
    The M3's biggest contribution to both driver safety and the performance industry is BMW's
    continual development of their limited-slip differential,
    which mathematically maximizes torque and grip without compromising handling.</p>

    <h3>E46</h3>

    <p>The M3 version of the E46 3 Series was produced in coupé and convertible body styles.
The E46 M3 is powered by the S54 straight-six engine and has a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 5.1 seconds for the coupé,
with either the manual or SMG-II transmission.[59][60] The skidpad cornering results are 0.89 g for the coupé and 0.81 g for the convertible.[61][62]
The top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).[60]
The kerb weight is 1,570 kg (3,461 lb).



<h3>E92</h3>

The M3 model of the E90/E92/E93 3 Series range was powered by the BMW S65 V8 engine and was produced in sedan,
convertible and coupé body styles. The E9x is the first and only standard production M3 powered by a V8 engine as its successor would revert to using a straight 6 engine.
In the standard M3, the S65 engine rated at 309 kW (420 PS; 414 hp) at 8,300 rpm[98] and 400 N⋅m (295 lb⋅ft) at 3,900 rpm.
Initially, the M3 was produced with a 6-speed manual transmission. In April 2008, the E90/E92/E93 M3 became the first BMW to be available with a dual-clutch transmission
when the 7-speed Getrag "M-DCT" transmission was introduced as an option.


<h3>F80</h3>
The M3 version of the F30 3 Series was designated the F80 and was produced from 2014 to 2018.[141]
The F80 M3 was powered by the BMW S55 twin-turbocharged straight-six engine, therefore being the first turbocharged M3 model.
Despite the smaller displacement than the V8 engine used by the previous generation of M3, the switch from naturally aspirated engines
 to turbocharging resulted in peak power being increased from 309 to 317 kW (420 to 431 PS; 414 to 425 hp),
and peak torque being increased from 400 to 550 N⋅m (295 to 406 lb⋅ft).
